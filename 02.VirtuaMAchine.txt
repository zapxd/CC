Link to download Virtual Box -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geQom5xl1YJhVa0YBtZrB3hH00dDietN/view?usp=sharing
VM machine ubuntu -> https://bit.ly/3MDZ940


Software required - Virtual Box and Virtual machine harddisk(ubuntu)


1. Open Virtaul Box
2. Click new and give name VM1
3. Type - Linux & Version Ubuntu 64bit -> Next -> Use and existing Virtual Hard disk and then choose our Virtual machine harddisk(ubuntu)

4. similarly create VM2


Now(inside Viratul box)
Click File -> Preferences -> Network -> Click + sign it there is not NAT network -> Ok


Right click VM1 -> Settings -> Network -> then select attached to NAt = NAT Network -> Ok

Similary do for VM2

Now we have to start both the VM
for this either double click on both the VMs or click the Start button

now the both the VM Windows will take time to load once its done it will ask for Login

use vagrant for login 
and password is also = vagant

login in both the VMs

Now we have to check the Ip address of both the VMs

use the below command in both the VMs

-> ifconfig

we will see that the inet address of both the VMs is different 


check if there are any files in VM1
-> ls

now create a file
-> touch file1.txt

-> cat file1.txt

-> nano file1.txt 

now a editor like interface will be shown
enter some text in it like - 
Hello World . This is CC practical

now Control + S to save the file 
then Control + X

now we have to tranfer the file to VM2

now in VM2 
-> ls

in VM1 
-> cat file1.txt

-> scp file1.txt vagrant@10.0.2.16:/home/vagrant

Note here 10.0.2.16 this number is the inet address of VM2 that we got earlier by ifconfig command

then say yes 
then passeword - vagrant

then it will transfer our file 


Now in VM2 
-> ls

-> cat file1.txt



Now if we want to tranfer file from VM2 to vm1 then use the same steps just change the inet address
